Wonder Shaper is a script that allows the user to limit the bandwidth of
one or more network adapters. 
It does so by using iproute's tc command, but greatly simplifies its 
operation. 
Wonder Shaper was first released by Bert Hubert in 2002, but the 
original version lacked a command-line interface, from on version 1.2 
this feature was added. 
From version 1.3, the HTB queuing is used instead of CBQ, allowing 
better bandwidth management on high speed (above ten megabits) links.
In version 1.4 an improved ingress shaping method was implemented and 
the ability to limit either down or up (both is still possible too).
The original README is a rather lengthy document and is saved under 
README.bhubert, for those who'd like some more background information.
Except any notes on operation this document is considered up-to-date.
