LightDM is a cross-desktop display manager. A display manager is a 
daemon that:
* Runs display servers (e.g. X) where necessary.
* Runs greeters to allow users to pick which user account and session
  type to use.
* Allows greeters to perform authentication using PAM.
* Runs session processes once authentication is complete.
* Provides remote graphical login options.

Key features of LightDM are:

* Cross-desktop - supports different desktop technologies.
* Supports different display technologies (X, Mir, Wayland ...).
* Lightweight - low memory usage and fast performance.
* Guest sessions.
* Supports remote login (incoming - XDMCP, VNC, outgoing - XDMCP,
  pluggable).
* Comprehensive test suite.

The core LightDM project does not provide any greeter with it and you
should install a greeter appropriate to your system. Popular greeter
projects are:

* LightDM GTK+ Greeter - a greeter that has moderate requirements (GTK+)
* LightDM KDE - greeter used in KDE (Qt)
* LXqt Greeter - greeter used in LXqt (Qt)
* Pantheon Greeter - greeter used in elementary OS (GTK+/Clutter).
* Unity Greeter - greeter used in Unity.
* WebKit2 Greeter - greeter that can be themed using HTML/CSS/Javascript
* Run with no greeter (automatic login only)
* Write your own...

See README.SLACKWARE for post-installation configuration.
