PeaZip is a free file archiver utility, similar to WinRar, WinZip, 
and 7-Zip (or File Roller, and Ark on Linux), based on Open Source
technologies of 7-Zip / p7zip archiver, Facebook Zstandard compressor,
FreeArc, Google Brotli compressor, PAQ family of compressors, 
PEA (archiving and encryption) project, and other Free Software file
compression tools.

This is a repackaging of PeaZip portable, GTK2 version.
